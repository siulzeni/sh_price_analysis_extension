#StubHub Price Analysis Extension
This is a Chrome Extension that makes opening StubHub Price Analysis from an Event's page
as easy as one click.

##Motivation
When I browse StubHub event listings looking for new artists and events, I always like to check demand. Opening the Price
Analysis tool usually takes me 3 to 4 clicks and a copy/pase. I know it's not a lot, but when I laizly browse for new
events I like to relax and search with one hand. I came up with this solution to further enable my laziness.

#How It Works
Simply go to the event page and click the extension button. It will open Price Analysis for that particular event. Simple as that

##Installing
- Download the package.zip onto your machine and unzip into any location of your choosing.
- Go to Chrome Extensions (chrome://extensions) and on the top right corner, check "Developer Mode".
- You will see three new buttons, one being "Load unpacked extension...". Click that button.
- Search and select the folder where you unpacked the extension, load it, and you're all set.

##Built with
- JavaScript
- HTML
- XML
- Chrome.tabs API

##Permissions
This extension requires the chrome 'tabs' permission in order to access the current URL as well as open new tabs.
If you click "Permissions" under the extension name, it says it can read your browsing history. This extension
does not access any history, but it does access the current URL, so that's possibly where that comes from.

##Issues
I've been using it for a while, I've found no bugs so far. If you find any, please let me know

##Why didn't I upload it to the Chrome Web Store?
It's a very niche extension thus I didn't deem it worthy to upload to the Chrome Web Store. Distribution
would be much easier, but I'd like to give people the option to comb the source code and verify nothing 
malicious is going on.

##Suggestions and Requests
They are very welcome. Leave a comment or shoot me an email and I'll see what I can do.
