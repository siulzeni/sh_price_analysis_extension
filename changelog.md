## Version 1.1:
- Added ability to open Price Analysis Tool from a link in your top most clipboard position
- Made popup more concise

## Version 1.2:
- New feature: When in PriceAnalysis, click extension again to be taken to the SellHub for that particualr event.

## Version 1.3:
- New feature: Copy an artist/event name to your clipboard and click extension. It will take you to the general SellHub for that artist/event.
- It's not 100% consistent, but that's a StubHub issue you encounter on the regular, not due to the extension

## Version 1.4
- Since Sell Hub has become useless for price analysis, copying artist/event name directs you to a normal stubhub search, rather than sell hub search.

## Version 1.5
- Removed restrictions that limited search to only when you were on StubHub. Now, copy an artist/event name anywhere you are, click extension, and it'll perform a   StubHub search
## Version 2.0
- Added context menu action
