##Version 1.1:
- Added ability to open Price Analysis Tool from a link in your top most clipboard position
- Made popup more concise

##Version 1.2:
- New feature: When in PriceAnalysis, click extension again to be taken to the SellHub for that particualr event.

##Version 1.3:
- New feature: Copy an artist/event name to your clipboard and click extension. It will take you to the general SellHub for that artist/event.
- It's not 100% consistent, but that's a StubHub issue you encounter on the regular, not due to the extension
